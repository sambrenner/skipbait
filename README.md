SkipBait
=========

__Skip over the pastures of content farms and go straight to the milk.__ 

SkipBait is a webservice and browser extension that allows content farms to be skipped over in daily web browsing. 

Sites like BuzzFeed and HuffPo use bombastic headlines and thumbnail images as bait to lure you towards embedded content so they can collect data on you and serve you ads. SkipBait bypasses this, meaning that links leading to content farms are redirected straight to the source material (where you will likely encounter more ads and trackers, but that's for a different project to handle).

Why?
---
We need to demand more of online media outlets. They have a responsibly in selecting and distributing content that is being ignored so that ad impressions can be maximized.

We also need to demand more of ourselves, as media consumers and sharers, to be aware of when we are being manipulated by media outlets.

These points address much larger issues than this project can solve, but I hope this helps create a conversation that will push us in the right direction.

SkipBait pairs well with ad blockers, tracker blockers, and script blockers.
