SkipBait
=========

__Skip over the pastures of content farms and go straight to the milk.__ 

SkipBait is a webservice and browser extension that allows content farms to be skipped over in daily web browsing. Content farms like BuzzFeed and HuffPo use bombastic headlines as bait to lure you towards embedded content so they can present you with ads, trackers, and obligatory, bland commentary. SkipBait bypasses this, meaning that links leading to content farms are redirected straight to the source material (where you will likely encounter more ads and trackers, but that's for a different project to handle).
